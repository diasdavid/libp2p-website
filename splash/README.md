# libp2p animation

- fade in parts
- fade in h1
- assemble parts
- throb cube
- slide in strapline and button

## Reverse engineering

- `1.html` is the dom when the blocks are all faded in, but still in original positions
- `2.html` is the dom when the blocks are all assembled in the centerStage
- `splash.html` is commited at state 1, and then commited at state 2 for super git diffing.
